- 👋 Hi, I’m @pixelarx
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 and how to use Rider, Perforce, Github, Jira, Kubuntu and GenAI for game development.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game development topics!
- 📫 How to reach me? I am probably going to host pixelarx.com! Which will of course have a "Contact Us" page. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can hold my breath for 2 minutes underwater without passing out. I mean I was able to when I was younger.
